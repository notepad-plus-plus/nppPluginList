**Notepad++ Plugin List** is an official collection of Notepad++ plugins. It helps built-in Plugin Admin in Notepad++ to install/update/remove the plugins as users desire.

The list is in json format, but encapsulated in a binary (DLL), so it can be signed by a certificate to avoid being hacked. Any Notepad++ plugin is welcome to be submit here, but please test it locally before doing your PR. To review the current list of plugins and their features see the generated list of Plugindescriptions in either [64-Bit Plugin List](doc/plugin_list_x64.md) or [32-Bit Plugin List](doc/plugin_list_x32.md).

Here are all the informations you need for doing tests locally:
