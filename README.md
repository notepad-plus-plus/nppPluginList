**nppPluginList** is an official collection of Notepad++ plugins. It helps built-in Plugin Admin in Notepad++ to install/update/remove the plugins as users desire.

The list is in json format, but encapsulated in a binary (DLL), so it can be signed by a certificate to avoid being hacked. Any Notepad++ plugin is welcome to be submit here, but please test it locally before doing your PR. Here are all the informations you need for doing tests locally:
